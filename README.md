# Repo contents
So far, the repo only contains a research proposal which is the deliverable for Assignment 2. It can be found in various formats in the [Presentation](Presentation/) subfolder or directly as a PDF under this [link](Presentation/Assignment2_PaperOutline.pdf).

At a later stage, this repo will be expanded to include all the remaining assignments for the Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis class also.
